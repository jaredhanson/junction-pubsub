# Junction/PubSub

[XMPP](http://xmpp.org/) [Publish-Subscribe](http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0060.html)
framework for [Node](http://nodejs.org), built on [Junction](http://github.com/jaredhanson/junction).

Junction/PubSub is a minimalist framework layered on top of Junction, providing
robust tooling to applications that need publish-subscribe functionality  The
Junction/PubSub architecture is modeled upon the proven pairing of [Connect](http://www.senchalabs.org/connect/)
+ [Express](http://expressjs.com/), making development of XMPP applications as
simple as that of web applications.
